## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [SEF E-Invoice Integration](https://github.com/BRadivojevic/sef-einvoice-php)
> Automated XML e-invoice generation, validation, and SEF API submission.  
> Handles 20K+ invoices per month with <1% error rate.

**Key Features**
- Outbound invoice handling (send one-by-one or in bulk)
- Status tracking and filtering
- Inbound invoice management with approve/disapprove logic
- XML/PDF attachments, Tabulator.js interface, and full SEF sync
- Automated fetch of unseen SEF invoices from SEF API

# [Elasticsearch Reindex Worker](https://github.com/BRadivojevic/php-elasticsearch)
> High-throughput reindexing and data ingestion system for Elasticsearch 7.17.x and SQL Server 2019+.  
> Handles millions of rows per job with zero downtime, background workers, and idempotent upserts via `acckey`.

## 🧠 Overview
This project is a production-grade PHP reindexing system built for large SQL Server datasets synchronized into Elasticsearch.  
It automatically batches records, retries failed bulk operations, and uses background workers to bypass 524/534 Cloudflare timeouts.  
It was engineered for resilience, scalability, and correctness in real business environments.

## ⚙️ Highlights
- 🚀 Background workers — long jobs run outside HTTP, safe from Cloudflare limits  
- 🧩 Batching with ROW_NUMBER() / OFFSET — handles multi-million-row tables  
- 🔁 Idempotent upserts — every document uses acckey as Elasticsearch _id  
- 💾 Job queue — file or SQL Server-based persistence  
- ⚖️ Retry logic + dead-letter queue for bad docs  
- 🧹 Normalization of dates, nulls, and diacritics  
- 📊 JSON logging for dashboards and traceability  

## 🚀 Quick Start

1️⃣ Install dependencies
```bash
composer install
```

2️⃣ Copy `.env.example` → `.env`
```env
ES_HOSTS=http://localhost:9200
MSSQL_HOST=localhost
MSSQL_DB=benussi
MSSQL_USER=sa
MSSQL_PASSWORD=YourStrong!Passw0rd
```

3️⃣ Enqueue a reindex job
```bash
POST /public/queue-reindex.php
{
  "source_index": "benussi_flota_source",
  "dest_index": "benussi_flota_target",
  "tenant": "flota"
}
```

4️⃣ Run the background worker
```bash
php workers/reindex_worker.php
```

or directly import SQL data:
```bash
php workers/insert_bulk_worker.php index=benussi_flota sql=examples/select_batch_row_number.sql start=1 end=10000
```

## 🧩 Data Normalization
All SQL data is sanitized before indexing:
- Empty or 1900-01-01 → null  
- Diacritics normalized (č → c, ž → z, đ → dj)  
- Trims and type normalization for safe ingestion

## 🪣 Dead-Letter Handling
Invalid or failed documents (e.g., missing acckey, ES bulk errors) are saved to:
```
var/deadletter.jsonl
```
Each line contains the failed document and error cause — perfect for post-analysis.

## 🧱 Example SQL Batching

**ROW_NUMBER version**
```sql
WITH src AS (
  SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY [Id]) AS rn, *
  FROM dbo.LargeTable WITH (NOLOCK)
)
SELECT * FROM src
WHERE rn BETWEEN ? AND ?;
```

**OFFSET/FETCH version**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM dbo.LargeTable WITH (NOLOCK)
ORDER BY [Id]
OFFSET ? ROWS FETCH NEXT ? ROWS ONLY;
```
